# INTRA-EU EXPORTS Nowcasting
#
# This script initializes the environment, prepares the data, fits nowcasting models,
# and generates forecast outputs for international trade (Intra-EU exports) across multiple countries.
#
# Key Outputs:
# - Nowcasted intra-export values (monthly) using multivariate and univariate TRAMO models.
# - Trade-weighted indicators prepared for modeling (HICP, Exchange Rates, IPI,Intra-EU Import ).
# - Final forecast results exported in structured formats (Excel, JSON).
#
# Estimated Runtime:
# - ~3 minutes if real-time data download (current nowcast period).
# - ~10 seconds if pre-saved datasets are used (historical or future nowcast periods).
#
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Ensure the R environment is restored using `renv::restore()`.
# 2. Run this script to execute the full nowcasting workflow.
#
# Notes:
# - The modeling is configured dynamically based on the `nowcast_period` setting.
# - Updates to trade weights are necessary for forecasts beyond 2025.
